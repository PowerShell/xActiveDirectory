  - Added Integration tests.

### Changed

- ADManagedServiceAccount
  - KerberosEncryptionType property added. ([issue #511](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/511)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: AccountType parameter ValidateSet changed from ('Group', 'Single') to ('Group', 'Standalone') - Standalone is the correct terminology. Ref: [Service Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts).
  ([issue #515](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/515)).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: AccountType parameter default of Single removed. - Enforce positive choice of account type.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: MembershipAttribute parameter ValidateSet member SID changed to ObjectSid to match result property of Get-AdObject. Previous code does not work if SID is specified.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: AccountTypeForce parameter removed - unnecessary complication.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Members parameter renamed to ManagedPasswordPrincipals - to closer match Get-AdServiceAccount result property PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword. This is so that a DelegateToAccountPrincipals parameter can be added later.
  - Common Compare-ResourcePropertyState function used to replace function specific Compare-TargetResourceState and code refactored.
  ([issue #512](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/512)).
  - Resource unit tests refactored to use nested contexts and follow the logic of the module.
